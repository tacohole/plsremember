      <h3>Hi welcome! Wondering what this is? Let me explain:</h3>
      <p>
      Please Remember is a website where you give me your email address, and I send 
      a little tweet-length message to that email once a day. It might be <a href="https://silverbirchpress.wordpress.com/2013/06/13/the-plum-trees-poem-by-mary-oliver/">a poetry snippet</a>,
      or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNG_uJhCbbI">scene</a> from The Sopranos, or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guqFqcV4Po0">song</a>, or a sports highlight. 
      I won't send you anything aside from the daily message, I won't ask you for any money, I won't give your email
      address to anyone, and I'll never put an ad on this site or in an email.
      </p>
